# Predicting Students Grades Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project explores the use of machine learning models to predict students' grades based on various academic, demographic, and behavioral factors. It applies a robust data preprocessing pipeline and compares the performance of multiple machine learning algorithms to identify the best predictive model.

The project is a demonstration of my ability to handle real-world data, build predictive models, and perform comprehensive analysis to derive actionable insights.
